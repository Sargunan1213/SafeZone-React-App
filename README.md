## BACKGROUND:
Our project provides a platform to help reducing the spread of the virus by providing quarantined rooms to the frontline workers. In addition, all users can check out the recent updates and number of covid-19 patients on our website. They can also communicate with us by using the contact us button in the bottom. There are four different types of users namely, homeowners, front-line workers, visitors and lastly the admin.


## SUMMARY:
Our application can be easily installed by following the succeeding steps.  We have used React to code our application in order to simplify and make cleaner code. Running the application will lead the user to our home page which provides the user with the option to sign up or sign in using the navigation bar above. The user can also access five features to check available rooms, track the current COVID-19 cases, donate, access our feed or provide feedback. 

 Login credentials for regular user:
  username: user
  Password: user
Login credentials for admin:
 username: admin
 Password: admin

## USE:
Once logged in, the user can add a post for renting out his place by clicking on the Add Post button from the navbar. He can also see his posts by clicking on the My posts button from the navbar. Clicking on the user button will enable him to see his profile info and select a profile photo.
The admin will be provided with an admin panel which provides him the ability to delete posts, users and also a platform to message all users.
